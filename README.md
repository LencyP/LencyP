# Hi, my name is Lenka :sparkles:

One day I started to learn how to code out of curiosity and I would never have expected that the IT world would be my thing... after a few months, I realized, that yes, it's my thing and I enjoy the neverending learning process. 
I am passionate about good UI/UX, data analyses, and responsive websites but also I like to have fun and just try to build easy games or apps with APIs.
