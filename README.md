# Hi, my name is Lenka :sparkles:

One day I started to learn coding out of curiosity and I've never expected that it will be my thing... and after few months, I've realized, that yes, undeniably programming is my thing and till now I really enjoy neverending process of learning. At this time I am working hard on JavaScript and React. 
I am passionate about good UI/UX and responsive websites but also I like to have fun and just trying to build easy games or apps with APIs.
