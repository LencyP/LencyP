# Hi, my name is Lenka :sparkles:

I like to code in my free time, it's maybe strange for some people but I really enjoy neverending process of learning. At this time I am working hard on JavaScript and React.
I am passionate about beautiful, responsive but also practical websites. I guess because it's very creative but at the same time logical.
