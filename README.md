# Hi, my name is Lenka :sparkles:

I like to code in my free time, it's maybe strange for some people but I really enjoy neverending learning process, at this moment I am working hard on JavaScript and React.
I am passionate about beautiful and responsive websites, but also about functionality of website in general. I guess because it's very creative but at the same time logic.
